# ECL

This repository contains several of the projects I worked on during my studies at Ecole Centrale de Lyon. Projects relating to similar topics have been grouped together, the name of the actual course it belongs to is always stated in the README.md file.

Most of the projects are driven by my wish to pursue Machine and Deep Learning, however I also included other interesting Computer Science projects I have been working on.

Many of the original directories these projects can be found at https://gitlab.ec-lyon.fr/agiard, which contains the timeline commits over the year for the different project.

Currently, I have added the projects relating to the courses:
- *MSO 3.4: Machine learning*
- *MSO 3.7: Bayesian machine learning and text mining*
- *MOD 2.3: Statistical engineering*
- *MOD 4.6: Deep learning & artificial intelligence : an introduction*
- *MOD 7.2: Machine Learning and Data Mining*
- *MSO 3.1: Computer-based technology for Big Data*
- *MOS 8.5: Computer Graphics*

I have also published a website in French doing a state-of-the-art of AI applications in Molecular Biology (https://sites.google.com/view/ai-and-molecular-biology/accueil).

Additional projects I have worked on during my time at Centrale can also be found at the following links:
