# Computer Graphics: Ray Tracer

## Description

This project involved building a ray-tracing renderer in C++. It successfully rendered scenes with spheres and lighting effects, demonstrating the fundamentals of ray-tracing. The project was further extended to incorporate basic lighting models, increasing the visual realism of the rendered scenes. To represent more complex objects, ways render scenes with triangle meshes were added to the project. There were however issues regarding the implementation of textures that have not been solved.

The Images folder contains images generated by this renderer.

The Models folder contains the __cat__ object file used in the code.

The full report in French done for the course *MOS 8.5: Computer Graphics* contains an in depth explanation of the project.
